I've created a small enterprise to propose some "professional services", around Galette among others (all requests will be considered) :-)

What I propose:
- Galette instances hosting (restricted number),
- install Galette on your hosting,
- developments on Galette core, plugins, or new plugins,
- software troubleshooting,
- ...

Some may ask what that will change for Galette project...
<br/>Answer is simple: absolutely nothing.

Sponsored features will be integrated once finalized, but Galette will stay a free (as in free beer) and open source project. I will continue to work on the project like I did for years.

I've set up a dedicated website as well as dedicated ways for contact:
<br/>[https://pro.galette.eu](https://pro.galette.eu)

If you have projects or questions, feel free to contact me :-)

See you soon!
